## August 10-12: Graphs and Networks

Hotel reservations have been made for everyone at the Hilton Arlington. The hotel is located immediately adjacent to the Ballston-Marymount University metro stop and the full street address is as follows:

**Hilton - Arlington**  
**950 North Stafford Street**  
**Arlington, VA 22203 USA**

Please note there is also a Hilton-Arlington (National Landing) location on Richmond Highway. This is NOT the right hotel. Make sure to put the right address into your phone GPS.

Participants are encouraged to take the Metro trains to the hotel. The Metro is easily accessible from both airports and Union Station in Washington D.C. The hotel has an adjacent metro stop. To get a metrocard, go to the kiosks at the station. You should purchase a Smartrip card and load it with at least $8 of funds (from DCA) or $14 of funds (from IAD). The physical card costs $2.00 on top of the funds you load to the card. You can also download the [SmartTrip app](https://www.wmata.com/fares/mobilepay/) to your phone and have the card located in either Google Pay or Apple Wallet. **For either option, keep a receipt so that you can be reimbursed for your transportation costs.**

Please note that rideshare and taxi options are also available, but are significantly more expensive. If you want to take this form of transportation and be reimbursed, this must be pre-approved by the organizers.

**From the Airports:**

**Reagan National Airport (DCA)** is the closest airport to the hotel, and most of you will be flying here. Participants flying into Reagan will be able to get to the hotel via the Metro at the National Metro Station attached to the airport. To find the metro, follow signs for ‘baggage claim’ and then follow signs for the metro. Take the escalator to the upper level and the metro station is not far.

At the National Airport stop, take the Blue line (towards Largo) five stops and get off at Rosslyn. At Rosslyn, switch to either the Orange or Silver line (going towards Vienna Fairfax-GMU). Ride for four stops, and exit at the Ballston-Marymount University (MU) exit. Once you exit the metro, take the escalator straight into the building adjacent with the sign “Ballston Metro Center” above the doors. The Hilton-Arlington is located in this building. The whole trip should take around 25-35 minutes and cost approximately $3.40.

**Dulles International Airport (IAD)** is a bit further from the hotel, but still easily accessible via the metro and requires no transfers. Participants flying out of Dulles will be able to get to the hotel via the Washington Dulles International Airport Metro Station attached to the airport. Once you exit the plane, follow signs for baggage claim. Once you arrive at the carousels, follow signs for the metro and exit through the 6th ramp. It’s a bit of a walk, but don’t worry, you’re on the right path and there are plenty of signs leading you to the station.

Once you arrive at the metro station, take the Silver line (it’s the only line at this stop) heading towards Largo for 10 stops. Exit at the Ballston-Marymount University (MU) stop. Once you exit the metro, take the escalator straight into the building adjacent with the sign “Ballston Metro Center” above the doors. The Hilton-Arlington is located in this building. The whole trip should take around 45 minutes to an hour and cost $6.75.

**From Union Station:**

Union Station is the major train station located in the heart of Washington D.C. To get to the hotel from Union Station, go to the Union Station Metro Station located right outside of the departures and arrivals area. Once you arrive at the station, take the Red Line (going towards Shady Grove) and stay on for 3 stops. Exit at Metro Center, where you will go downstairs to the lower level to switch to the Silver Line (towards Ashburn). Once on the Silver Line, ride for 8 stops, and exit at the Ballston-Marymount University (MU) stop. Once you exit the metro, take the escalator straight into the building adjacent with the sign “Ballston Metro Center” above the doors. The Hilton-Arlington is located in this building. The whole trip should take around 30-45 minutes and cost approximately $3.70.

**From the Hotel to the Workshop:**

**Van Metre Hall**  
**210, Classroom (ALC)**  
**Mason Square**

The Math Humanists workshops will be held at the George Mason University-Arlington Campus in Van Metre Hall. Van Metre Hall is about 0.7 miles away from the hotel, or a 15 minute walk and is located on Fairfax Drive, the same street as the Ballston-MU Metro stop.

Once you exit the hotel, turn right onto Fairfax Drive and start walking down the street. You should pass a Subway right when you turn and a Wells Fargo Bank location in about 500 feet. Continue walking down Fairfax Drive until you reach N. Kenmore Street (about 10 blocks). Van Metre Hall will be located on the left side of the street, right before the George Mason University Law Library and the Antonin Scalia Law School. See the photo on the next page for more context. The workshop will be held in room 210.

**Food, Coffee, and Drinks:**

The Hilton-Arlington is located right next to the Ballston Quarter, a mall with a number of restaurants, cafes, and shops. The mall opens at 11 AM, but individual restaurants have different hours. For more information, visit this [website. ](https://www.ballstonquarter.com/en/directory/)

If you would like to eat breakfast or get coffee before the workshop, there is a Starbucks located inside the same complex as the hotel. Along the walk to Van Metre Hall, there is an IHOP, Starbucks, Aroma Coffee, and a Le Café Market along the route, all right off Fairfax Drive. A bit past N. Kenmore Street there is also a Detour Coffee and a Dunkin’ Donuts a few blocks over from Fairfax Drive.

**Accessibility:**

If you have any concerns about the directions above or need accommodations to make the workshop accessible to you, please contact Caroline Greer ([cgreer2@gmu.edu](mailto:cgreer2@gmu.edu)) or Jessica Otis ([jotis2@gmu.edu](mailto:jotis2@gmu.edu)). We will be glad to discuss different options and help make arrangements for you if necessary.

**Final Notes:**

We look forward to welcoming you to George Mason and DH2024 in August! We hope these directions will make your travel a bit easier. Send any questions to me, Caroline, at [cgreer2@gmu.edu](mailto:cgreer2@gmu.edu).

Once more, make sure to keep any receipts you receive for your Metro travel to and from the airport and hotel. This will allow you to be reimbursed for the cost of your trip. Of course, feel free to use taxis, Lyft, or Uber if you desire, but once again, this will not be reimbursed unless pre-authorized.
